# Stock_Price_Prediction_ML
This repository contains Python code demonstrating a machine learning workflow for predicting stock prices using a Linear Regression model.
Stock Price Prediction with Linear Regression.The code is organized as follows:

Files:
stock_price_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire code workflow.
AAPL.csv: Sample dataset (Apple Stock Data) used for training and evaluation.
Overview:
This project showcases the steps involved in building a simple machine learning model for stock price prediction. It covers the following key steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, and necessary preprocessing steps are applied (e.g., renaming columns, dropping unnecessary columns).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

A time series plot is generated to visualize the historical stock prices.
Train-Test Split:

The data is split into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.
Linear Regression Model:

A Linear Regression model is trained on the training data to learn the relationships between the features and the target variable (next day's stock price).
Model Evaluation:

The model's performance is assessed using various metrics including R-squared, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Results and Visualization:

Actual vs. predicted stock prices are visualized using time series plots.
Usage:
To run the code and replicate the analysis:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the required libraries installed (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.).
Open and run the stock_price_prediction.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment.
Disclaimer:
This project is intended for educational purposes and as a basic demonstration of stock price prediction using a simple Linear Regression model. Real-world applications would require more sophisticated models, extensive data analysis, and consideration of additional factors.
